\chapter{Biophysical background}
Proteins are one of the essential components of living systems. Along with nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and lipids, proteins constitute the macromolecules that have important roles in biology. 
Nucleic acids, in the form of DNA and RNA, store and distribute the genetic information as needed. Of particu- lar importance is the information that determines the sequences of amino acids that characterize the proteins. Proteins contribute to the structure of an organism and execute most of the tasks required for it to function. Proteins even form part of the complex mechanism by which they are synthesized. Polysaccharides, linear and branched-chain polymers of sugars, provide structural elements, store energy, and when combined with peptides or pro- teins, play an important role in antigenicity and, more generally, in cellular recognition. Lipids, which include molecules such as fatty acids, phospho- lipids, and cholesterol, serve as energy sources and are the most important components of the membrane structures that organize and compartmentalize cellular function.

\subsection{Macromolecules}
Molecules are generated by the formation of covalent bonds between pairs of atoms, in which the two atoms share electrons. A covalent bond forms when atoms individually do not have enough electrons for a complete octet: if two atoms can complete their octets by sharing electrons, they can do so by forming a covalent bond. Covalent bonds can be explained only by quantum mechanics, but here it is necessary simply to recognize that covalent bonds are generally not broken in isolation under most conditions experienced in molecular biology. When a covalent bond is broken, as in a chemical or enzymatic reaction, it is generally exchanged with another covalent bond to a different atom. Consequently, covalent bonds define the structures and properties of small molecules, and those of large molecules are determined by the covalent structures of the smaller substituents from which they are made.

The most important molecules in biology are proteins and the nucleic acids deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA); all are macromolecules characterized by their very large sizes and high molecular weights. These giant molecules can contain many thousands, millions, even billions, of atoms. Fortunately, these macromolecules are polymers, produced by linking together in a linear fashion only a few relatively simple monomers: four nucleotides in the case of DNA and RNA, and 20 amino acids in the case of proteins. In each of these cases, each residue, $i$, of the chain consists of two parts: group $X$ comprises the backbone and is the constant, repeating part of the polymer, while the side-chains (A, B, C, ...) attached to the backbone are variable:\\
IMAGE\\
The side-chains connected to the backbone are all the same in homopolymers, as in carbohydrates or polymers made chemically, but they are variable in copolymers; the natural proteins and nucleic acids are extreme examples with several different types. Normally the individual residues are indexed from 1 to $n$, starting from one end of the polymer chain and finishing at the other. The bonds between the residues are numbered similarly, with bond $i$ joining residues $i$ and $i + 1$; there are then $n – 1$ bonds linking the $n$ residues. Normally the backbone primarily has a structural role, while the side-chains contain the functional groups. In spite of the enormous sizes of proteins and nucleic acids, it is possible to determine their detailed covalent structures because, knowing the detailed structures of all the possible monomers, it is necessary only to determine their linear sequence in the polymer.
The detailed structures of the monomers are extremely important, because they determine the global properties of the macromolecule. They occur many times in the polymer, and their structures are multiplied many times over. Many of the monomers occur in only one of several possible isomers; for example natural proteins are composed solely of $l$-amino acids and nucleic acids of $d$-ribose or $d$-deoxyribose. While these details of the structure might seem very minor and mundane, they have extremely important consequences for the three-dimensional (3-D) structures of biopolymers and their functions. These consequences even extend to the macroscopic level; for example, the left/right asymmetry of all but the simplest microorganisms is believed to result from asymmetry at the atomic level of certain molecules.

The understanding of how ligands bind to proteins is of fundamental importance in biology and medicine.\footnote{The structures of protein-ligand complexes at atomic resolution make possible, for example, the design of small-molecule drugs for the treatment of disease \cite{dunn2001protein}.} Indeed, the protein-ligand interactions are crucial for the determination of the biological functions and, as a consequence, these interactions underlie almost all processes occuring in living organisms. In fact, every aspect of the structure, growth and replication of an organism depends in general on the way the proteins bind ligands (i.e. small molecules, nucleic acids, peptides, other proteins, polysaccharides or lipid) \cite{creighton2010biophysical}.

The association processes that bring to the formation of the binding between a protein and its ligand, also known as complexation, occurs when the free-energy of the whole system (protein, ligand and solvent) is lower for the complexed state, $G^\text{(c)}$, than for uncomplexed one, $G^\text{(uc)}$. Defining the difference between $G^\text{(c)}$ and $G^\text{(uc)}$ as $\Delta G$, it is possible to divide $\Delta G$ into the following two terms:
\begin{equation*}
\label{free-en}
\Delta G = G^\text{(c)} - G^\text{(uc)} = \Delta H - T \Delta S
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta H$ is the change in enthalpy due to the electrostatic interactions, while $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy due to the variation of the number of microscopic configurations for the whole system that corresponds to the new macroscopic state, namely, the solvated protein-ligand complex.
%\begin{align*}
%\label{c-uc}
%&\Delta G < 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{\textit{the complex state is stable}} \\
%&\Delta G > 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{\textit{the uncomplex state is stable}}
%\end{align*}

Indeed, while studying this association processes, it is useful to identify the favorable and unfavorable contributions to the change in the free-energy of the system. Most of the unfavorable contribution is due to the loss of the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom that lead to a considerable decrease of the entropy of the system. Generally, it is assumed that this contribution is offset by favorable enthalpy of binding and entropic contributions, such as the hydrophobic effect, changes in the protonation state and solvent or counterion release. Nevertheless, there are other mechanisms, due to the creation or suppression of new internal degrees of freedom in the complex, that induce a change of the intrinsic entropy of the association by which a significant amount of entropy can be lost or recovered \cite{tidor1994contribution}. For this reason, it useful to divide $\Delta S$ in two contributions:
\begin{equation*}
\label{entropy-variation:total}
\Delta S = \Delta S_\text{intr} + \Delta S_\text{solv}
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta S_\text{solv}$ is the entropy change arising from accompanying modifications of interactions with the solvent, while $\Delta S_\text{intr}$ is the intrinsic change of the entropy involved in creating a dimer from two separate molecules \cite{steinberg1963entropy}. In particular, $\Delta S_\text{intr}$ represents the variation of the entropy due to the change of the number of configurations for the protein-ligand system upon the complexation (without considering the solvent) and, because of that, $\Delta S_\text{intr}$ is usually known as $\Delta S_\text{config} = S_\text{config}^\text{(c)} - S_\text{config}^\text{(uc)}$, where $S_\text{config}^\text{(c)}$ and $S_\text{config}^\text{(uc)}$ are the configuration entropy of the complexed and uncomplexed state, respectively. 

For each of these states, the configurational entropy represents a measure of the extent of the configuration space accessible to the internal degrees of freedom of the protein-ligand subsystem. In this way, the concept of configurational entropy is strongly connected to that of free-energy landscape and, as a consequece, a full characterization of the protein-ligand free-energy landscape is of fundamental importance to understand the relationship between the configurational entropy and the protein structure and the variation of these quantities upon ligand binding and conformational change. Unfortunately, the configurational entropy is known as one of the most difficult thermodynamic quantities to estimate and the characterization of the protein free-energy landscape is a difficult task due to its complexity and, in particular, to the fact that it is rugged, i.e., it comprises numerous local minima separated by low free-energy barriers \cite{chong2015dissecting}. 

In this regard, it was a keen insight to suppose that the protein configurational entropy $S_\text{config}$ may be characterized just by two terms, namely: 
\begin{equation*}
\label{entropy-variation:configurational}
\Delta S_\text{intr} \equiv \Delta S_\text{config} = \Delta S_\text{conf} + \Delta S_\text{vib}
\end{equation*}
where  $S_\text{conf}$ is the conformational components of the configurational entropy associated with the number of accessible free-energy wells \footnote{Sometimes, specially studying the protein folding phenomena, $\Delta S_\text{config}$ and  $\Delta S_\text{conf}$ might be used interchangeably even if they are not the same. This is why, in the protein folding process usually $\Delta S_\text{vib} \simeq 0$, hence $\Delta S_\text{conf} \simeq S_\text{conf}$ \cite{karplus1987configurational}.}, whereas $S_\text{vib}$ is the vibrational component that reflects the average width of the individual wells \cite{chong2015dissecting, karplus1987configurational}.%\footnote{Although attempts to dissect the relative magnitudes of different thermodynamic effects have been criticized as not formally correct, it remains helpful in understanding protein stability to estimate these individual contributions 
%\cite{doig1995side}.}.

\end{minipage} 
\end{figure}

This subdivision of $\Delta S_\text{config}$ in two different contributions was suggested for the first time in 1981 by Karplus and Kushickt \cite{karplus1981method}. Although, in 1994, Mark and van Gunsteren criticized these types of models that attempt to decompose the free-energy into a sum of several contributions arising from different thermodynamic effects \cite{mark1994decomposition}, it has been shown that meaningful decompositions are possible and, if made carefully, they can be very useful \cite{lazaridis2002thermodynamics}.

%In 1987, Karplus et all., studying the protein denaturation, shown that, even if the $S_\text{vib}$ is typically an order of magnitude larger than $S_\text{conf}$ whether the protein is folded or not, the most important change on folding is due to $\Delta S_\text{conf}$ because the $S_\text{vib}$ is essentially the same for a protein in its native conformation and for a single conformer of the denatured polypeptide chain (i.e. $\Delta S_\text{vib} \simeq 0$ upon denaturation). 
%However, they noticed that the large magnitude of $S_\text{vib}$ raises the possibility that it may have to be considered explicitly in some cases. This is most likely when apparently small perturbations are made on the protein and a quantitative estimate of the entropy change is required. One such case is exactly the ligand binding process 
%\cite{karplus1987configurational}.

%The aim of this thesis is to evaluate of the conformational entropy change upon the complexation of a particular protein-ligand system, evaluating its conformational entropy change taking into account the effect of the formation on the binding on the hydration water.

%The aim of the thesis is to study, with molecular dynamics simulations, the association process for a specific protein and ligand system to evaluate the resulting change of conformational entropy of the system and the consequences of this change on the hydration water. Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to obtain an atomistic detail of this process. The protein and the ligand chose for the simulation are:

The objective of the thesis is to study, with molecular dynamics simulations, the protein-ligand binding in a specific case to evaluate the change of the conformational entropy upon the complexation taking into account the effect of the hydration water. Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to obtain an atomistic detail of this process.
The protein and the ligand chose for the simulation are:

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\item[] \textbf{Ligand:} Maltose
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
MBP and Maltose have been chosen in order to compare some of the simulations' results with the measurements of inelastic neutron scattering performed on these systems by A. Paciaroni and colleges at ILL, not yet published.\footnote{MBP is a well studied model protein that plays an important role in the metabolism of Escherichia coli, e.g., in the energy-dependent translocation of maltose and maltodextrins through the cytoplasmic membrane. The ILL-EMBL Deuteration Laboratory (D-Lab) in Grenoble has developed a high-yield expression system to make available significant amounts of hydrogenated and fully deuterated MBP powder
\cite{paciaroni2008fingerprints}.}

On the other hand, Molecular Dynamics is one of the most widely used computer simulation techniques in material science and biophysics used to calculate the time evolution of a classical many-body system by numerically integrating Newton's equations of motion. It has two strong points, it is able to offer atomistic-level resolution and since it doesn't disrupt the kinetics of the system it allows for the calculation of transport properties and relaxation constants. However, when applied to large systems the sampling is limited by the currently available computational resources, e.g. the typical limit for a system of 100,000 atoms is the microsecond timescale. 

For this reason, many processes of biological relevance are not accessible with the current computational power. High-probability stable and metastable states of the conformational space are separated from each other by low-probability regions, also known as energetic barriers, the transition of which is a rare event in the timescales explored by Molecular Dynamics. One example of what this practically means is that it is impossible to observe, with a single simulation (known as brute force Molecular Dynamics), the folding event of any protein other than small peptides and ultrafast folders. Hence, the biological simulated systems are usually far from ergodicity and, to improve sampling and assess thermodynamic quantities, enhanced sampling techniques are used in combination with Molecular Dynamics.\cite{kalimeri}

In particular, different conformations are nonidentical spatial arrangements of the atoms of a molecule achieved solely by rotations about single covalent bonds. Molecules with identical covalent structures but different conformations are known as conformers (see figure below).

%Any conformation of a molecule of known covalent structure can be specified by the rotations about its single bonds, generally measured by either the torsion angle or the dihedral angle. In general, interactions between neighboring atoms, usually steric repulsions, mean that not all bond rotations have the same free energy and are equally probable

A large biological macromolecule can have a stable, fixed 3-D structure, referred to as its native conformation, if it has sufficient stabilizing interactions between its various atoms. Although most of the conformation is fixed and it is considered a single conformation, parts of the molecule may still be flexible and able to undergo rotations about certain bonds. The average overall conformation can be considered a macro-conformation, whereas the variations resulting from flexibility define various micro-conformations. Interconverting different macro-conformations requires a cooperative change of a number of bond rotations simultaneously, whereas micro-conformations are interconverted by changes of just one or a few bond rotations. These cooperative changes will usually occur only slowly or infrequently under physiological conditions, although it can be speeded up dramatically under denaturing conditions. This relatively slow interconversion of the two macro-conformations is described as a conformational change, in which the macromolecule has been converted from one family of micro-conformations to an experimentally distinguishable family of other micro-conformations
\cite{creighton2010biophysical}.

In the case of a protein, its conformations will depend whether on the structures and conformational properties of their residues that on the environment -- especially the relative interactions of the protein with the solvent and with itself.

In this picture, the conformational entropy is a measure of the ability to adopt a number of such conformations that stabilizes the flexible state. A single conformation will be adopted only if the interactions stabilizing that particular conformation are sufficiently strong to overcome the conformational entropy tending to keep the protein unfolded. The number of micro-conformations and the conformational entropies of proteins can be very large. For example, if each residue can adopt an average of $j$ conformations, and there are $N$ residues in the protein, the total number of conformations possible will be approximately $j^N$. If the reasonable assumption is made that $j$ is $8$ and $N$ is $500$, there will be $8^{500}$ ($\approx 10^{452}$) conformations possible, a truly astronomical number. Of course, some of these conformations will not be feasible because they would have atoms of the protein overlapping in space, the excluded volume effect. There is still, however, much scope to be conservative and predict an astronomical number of conformations. For example, even a short protein of 100 residues in which each residue could adopt only two different conformations could adopt more than $10^{30}$ different protein conformations. If all these conformations have similar free energies, each would have only a very small probability of occurring in a molecule. At 25 %\textdegree 
$^\circ$ C, the free energy contribution of the conformational entropy for a protein in which each residue can adopt 10 conformations will be 1.36 $N$ kcal/mol. Consequently, for any one conformation to predominate will require, on average, stabilizing interactions $>$1.36 kcal/mol/residue. In the absence of such stabilizing interactions, a protein will tend to exist in many different conformations. However, proteins and nucleic acids are able to adopt single folded conformations that predominate. Such stable conformations can be considered macro-conformations, in contrast to the micro-conformations that are adopted only transiently \cite{creighton2010biophysical}.


In the last years, there is a growing interest in the protein configurational entropy as a major factor in controlling the protein activities associated with signaling, regulation, and recognition.

In this regard, it was a keen insight to suppose that the protein configurational entropy ($S_\text{config}$) may be characterized just by two terms, i.e., the conformational ($S_\text{conf}$) and vibrational ($S_\text{vib}$) components.
The conformational component is associated with the number of accessible free-energy wells, whereas the vibrational component reflects the average width of the individual wells. (Although they are often used interchangeably, we shall refer to ``conformational'' entropy as a subcategory of ``configurational'' entropy as just described.) -> questo perché nel processo di folding e unfolding $S_\text{vib} \simeq 0$ e quindi $S_\text{config} = S_\text{conf} + S_\text{vib} \simeq S_\text{conf}$

Dissecting $S_\text{config}$ into $S_\text{conf}$ and $S_\text{vib}$ enables one to characterize modulations of the free-energy landscape caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors in simple terms; furthermore, it will facilitate the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying protein activities (in particular, those of intrinsically disordered proteins).

Configurational entropy, however, is known as one of the most difficult thermodynamic quantities to estimate, and a significant amount of effort has been devoted to developing computational methods for dealing with this quantity. 

Here, we propose a computational approach from a different perspective that is based on the classification of protein
dynamics on the free-energy landscape into conformational and vibrational contributions (Figure 1).

\newpage

In this context, studying the association processes that bring to the formation of the binding between a protein and its ligand, it is possible to decompose the free energy of the association of the two molecules into a summation of favorable and unfavorable contributions. The mainly unfavorable contribution is due to the loss of the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom that lead to a considerable decrease of the entropy of the system. Generally, it is assumed that this contribution is offset by favorable enthalpy of binding and entropic contributions, such as the hydrophobic effect, changes in the protonation state and solvent or counterion release. Nevertheless, there is another mechanism by which a significant amount of entropy can be recovered, namely, due to the creation of some new internal degrees of freedom in the complex \cite{tidor1994contribution}.

Indeed, because electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic bonds are not rigid or specific and the association is an outcome of such noncovalent interactions, the associating units (i.e. the protein and the ligand) have a considerable freedom of relative motion. This freedom, corresponding to an increase in flexibility for the complex and manifested by changes in its vibrational spectrum, is able to lead to a significant positive contribution for the entropy of the association (aside from the contribution from solvent effects, such as the hydrophobic effect) \cite{steinberg1963entropy}.

During the years, theoretical normal mode analyses, used to estimate this vibrational changes, have suggested that this effect is likely to be thermodynamically important and, in 2004, a first experimental determination of the vibrational changes has been achieved by Balog et al. Using inelastic neutron scattering, they showed that the vibrations of the complex soften significantly at low frequency (less then 2.5 meV) relative to the unbound protein. Deriving the resulting free-energy change from the variation in the density of states, they found that this effect contributes significantly to the binding equilibrium \cite{balog2004direct}.

Anyway, there remains much to learn about the various contributions to ligand binding free energies. Indeed, whether the vibrational softening effect seen here is general for protein-ligand interactions remains to be determined. The direct access to the vibrational density of states provided by inelastic neutron scattering holds promise for the study of vibrational thermodynamic changes in many biomolecular association processes \cite{balog2004direct}. 

Hence, to better understand this phenomena, in 2011 Balog et al., using computer simulations, recreated the system studied in the 2004 and reproduced the experimental results with an atomic detail normal-mode analysis to perform a characterization of the observed vibrational change.
With these simulations they obtain several interesting results concerning the nature of the vibrational changes in the specific protein-ligand complex studied\footnote{Some of these results concern the identification of the residues most affected by ligand binding and their contribution to protein compressibility \cite{balog2011vibrational}.}. However, as they report in their paper, these results cannot be generalized to other proteins and ligands since the effect depends on the strength of the interactions involved. 

Furthermore, the present analysis concentrates on the harmonic component of the dynamics.

oreover, they did not explain in detail the effect that the changes in the vibrational modes of the complex have in the vibrational spectrum of the hydration water.
