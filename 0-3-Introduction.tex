The objective of the thesis is to study, with molecular dynamics simulations, the protein-ligand binding in a specific case to evaluate the change of the conformational entropy upon the complexation taking into account the effect of the hydration water. Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to obtain an atomistic detail of this process.
The protein and the ligand chose for the simulation are:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{Protein:} Maltose-Binding Protein (MBP)
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\item[] \textbf{Ligand:} Maltose
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
MBP and Maltose have been chosen in order to compare some of the simulations' results with the measurements of inelastic neutron scattering performed on these systems by A. Paciaroni and colleges at ILL, not yet published.\footnote{MBP is a well studied model protein that plays an important role in the metabolism of Escherichia coli, e.g., in the energy-dependent translocation of maltose and maltodextrins through the cytoplasmic membrane. The ILL-EMBL Deuteration Laboratory (D-Lab) in Grenoble has developed a high-yield expression system to make available significant amounts of hydrogenated and fully deuterated MBP powder
